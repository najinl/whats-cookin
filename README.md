# What's Cookin'?

## Abstract
What's Cookin' is an application developed by a group of Mod2 students at the Turing School of Software & Design. When the user opens up the webpage they will see recipe cards they can favorite/unfavorite ❤️, add to a cook list/remove from cook list ➕, and view more details about (i.e. ingredients, instructions, recipe cost). A user can utilize the search bar at the top of the page to search recipes by names and/or ingredients or they can search by recipe tags (i.e. lunch, breakfast, dinner, appetizer) utilizing the "Recipe Type" checkboxes and filter button on the right-pane of the screen.

## Instrucitons to Access Application

1. On your Terminal: `git clone git@github.com:najinl/whats-cookin.git`
2. `cd`into the repository (directory)
3. Run the command `npm install`
4. Run the command `npm start`
5. Copy and paste `http://localhost:8080/` into your web browser!

## Testing 

Mocha and chai are already set up, with a boilerplate test for you. 

## Linting Your Code 

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit, but that's ok - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look only at the JavaScript files you have within the src and the test directories.
