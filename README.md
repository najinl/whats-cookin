# What's Cookin'?

## Abstract
What's Cookin' is an application developed by a group of Mod2 students at the Turing School of Software & Design. When the user opens up the webpage they will see recipe cards they can favorite/unfavorite ❤️, add to a cook list/remove from cook list ➕, and view more details about (i.e. ingredients, instructions, recipe cost). A user can utilize the search bar at the top of the page to search recipes by names and/or ingredients or they can search by recipe tags (i.e. lunch, breakfast, dinner, appetizer) utilizing the "Recipe Type" checkboxes and filter button on the right-pane of the screen.

## Set Up 

1. Within your group, decide on one person to have the project repository on their Github account. This person will *fork* this repository - on the top right corner of the page, click the fork button. 
2. All group members should then clone down the forked repository (make sure that everyone is added as a collaborator as well). Since you don't want your project to be named "whats-cookin-starter-kit", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` and visit `localhost:8080`
5. Make sure both members of your team are collaborators on the forked repo.

## Testing 

Mocha and chai are already set up, with a boilerplate test for you. 

## Linting Your Code 

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit, but that's ok - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look only at the JavaScript files you have within the src and the test directories.
